Welcome to this ooa. OOA stands for Open Operating Agreements. The goal is to have a set of operating agreements between parties / divisions that can act as a pstandard set of tooling for your IT services.

There will be a set of directories covering topics. In these directories you will find snippets of text. Of course I will try to make the procedures as usefull as possible for a Devops Kind of Way of working.

YOUR ROLE
---------

1.
For starters you can clone the directies and start using the text snippets. Of course these procedures and working agreements have to be agreed with all parties and individuals involved. I have not yet thought about a git culture repo.

2.
If you like the idea of open sourcing working procedures. You are most happy to contribute. For now I just started. But the more the merrier.
