Governance
==========

Introduction
------------
Having a good set of guidelines and expectations about decsision making, verification and information sharing is crucial to a streamlined IT organization. If it is internally or with outsourcing partners. These governance agreements will make the execution of the entire IT operations more easy. Never underestimate the downside of unclear structures within complex IT environments. Every ambigues rule or agreement will be interpreted that way and will slow down operations, business enhancements and projects.

Defining governance between divisions or parties is not easy. It boils down to some very basic and sudimentary questions. Those are:
1. Do we(I) really want to change my way of working to make this a succes?
2. Do we(I) really trust the other parties with an important piece of the IT puzzle 

Background
----------
Since 1990 IT projects and implementations have become complex. Complex because of two main reasons. First of allthe creation of IT is done by multiple entities. It is not uncommon that 6 parties have roles in the day to day operation of an IT environment. 
1. Business end users
2. Business Functional Change Drivers
3. Front End Developers
4. Back End Developers
5. System Integrators
6. Functional Application Engineers
7. Technical Application Engineers and 
8. Infrastructure partners
Next to those executors we see supporting roles and functions like:
1. project leaders
2. Product owners
3. scrum masters
4. Line managers
5. IT Architects
6. CIOs
Each of those parties will strive for the best outcome. Most of the times the entire overview gets lost in translation, day to day business priorities and (hidden) different agendas.

A clear agreement and discipline on working methods is crucial for the progress of projects and the quality of the services delivered. 

Working method
--------------
We define a number of working methods for different goals.

### Defining business need
The customer (business) always decides on what functionality is needed when. All other priorities can only be set after agreement with the customer.

From a Devops Perspective the Agile way of working is highly preferred. Lots of documentation can be found on how to create a good backlog. But in basic it means the following. The customer (business) defines a Product Owner. The PRoduct Owner owns the priorities of all functional wishes.

The product owner arranges with subdivisions / departments if they have priorities as well.
